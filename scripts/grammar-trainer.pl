# using  something  like dasher  we  can  create  a highspeed  grammar
# learning  program.  The  idea is  the  user watches  the grammar  at
# higher  and  higher  speeds,  and  greater  recognition  difficulty,
# (merging  the symbols),  to the  point  where it  can be  considered
# proven  that the  user knows  the grammar.   This way,  we  can walk
# through  various grammars,  ensuring completeness  by  measuring the
# number of tries
