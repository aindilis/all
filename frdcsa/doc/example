To whom it may concern,
	To those individuals concerned regarding this project, I spent
maybe 1 hour on it tonight and have some encouraging results to show.
	This is the project by which a users conceptual dictionary is
learned by the CLEAR program and items not seen before are defined.
For simplicity's sake, I have not written software here that might
build our conceptual vocabulary, nay, only used word sense
disambiguation (which is a pain to setup but which I guess I got
working before without knowing it) to determine a word's sense and
look it up in WordNet.  Long sentences take too long currently and in
lieu of devising some method I just print those sentences.  No effort
was given to reducing the number of obvious words in this script.
	There is obviously too much that can be done with this if you
understand the technology.  This would help in foreign language
aquisition.  It is a trivial matter to adopt this system to reading in
foreign languages, recursing on definitions, and accepting user
guidance.
	I hope this gives you a better picture of the possibilities
here.

?The? ?Fianna? of ?Erin? 

As the tales of the Ultonian Cycle duster round the heroic figure of the Hound of Cullan so do those of the Ossianic Cycle round that of Finn mac Cumhal pronounced mac Cool whose son Oisin pronounced Usheen or Ossian as Macpherson called him in the pretended translations from the Gaelic which first introduced him to the English speaking world was a poet as well as a warrior and is the traditional author of most of them

The events of the Ultonian Cycle are supposed to have taken place about the time of the birth of Christ

Those of the Ossianic Cycle fell mostly in the reign of Cormac mac Art who lived in the third century A D During his reign the Fianna of Erin who are represented as a kind of military Order composed mainly of the members of two clans Clan Bascna and Clan Morna and who were supposed to be devoted to the service of the High King and to the repelling of foreign invaders reached the height of their renown under the captaincy of Finn

The annalists of ancient Ireland treated the story of Finn and the Fianna in its main outlines as sober history

?This? ?it? can 
	| can#v#1 - preserve in a can or tin; "tinned foods are not very tasty"  
hardly 
	| hardly#r#1 - by a small margin; "they could barely hear the speaker"; "we hardly knew

be. 
	| be#v#1 - have the quality of being; (copula, used with an adjective or a predicate noun);
	| "John is rich"; "This is not a good answer"  


Ireland had no foreign invaders during the period when the Fianna are supposed to have flourished and the tales do not throw a ray of light on the real history of the country they are far more concerned with a Fairyland populated by supernatural beings beautiful or terrible than with any tract of real earth inhabited by real men and women

The modern critical reader of these tales will soon feel that it would be idle to seek for any basis of fact in this glittering mirage

But the mirage was created by poets and storytellers of such rare gifts for this kind of literature that it took at once an extraordinary hold on the imagination of the Irish and Scottish Gael

The Ossianic Cycle 
	| Cycle#v#1 - cause to go through a recurring sequence; "cycle thge laundry in this washing
	| program"  


The earliest tales of this cycle now extant are found in manuscripts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries and were composed probably a couple of centuries earlier

But the cycle lasted in a condition of vital growth for a thousand years right down to Michael Comyn s Lay of Oisin in the Land of Youth which was composed about 1750 and which ended the long history of Gaelic literature

subject of course to the possibility that the present revival of Gaelic as a spoken tongue may lead to the opening of a new chapter in that history

It has been estimated see Ossian and Ossianic Literature by Alfred Nutt p 4 that if all the tales and poems of the Ossianic Cycle which still remain could be printed they would fill some twenty five volumes the size of this

Moreover a very great proportion of this literature even if there were no manuscripts at all could during the last and the preceding centuries have been recovered from the lips of what has been absurdly called an illiterate peasantry in the Highlands and in the Gaelic speaking parts of Ireland

It cannot but interest us to study the character of the literature which was capable of exercising such a spell

	| Contrast#v#1 - put in opposition to show or emphasize differences; "The middle school
	| teacher contrasted her best student's work with that of her weakest student"	
?with? the ?Ultonian? Cycle 

Let us begin by saying that the reader will find himself in an altogether different atmosphere from that in which the heroes of the Ultonian Cycle live and move

Everything speaks of a later epoch when life was gentler and softer when men lived more in settlements and towns when the Danaan Folk were more distinctly fairies and less deities when in literature the elements of wonder and romance predominated and the iron string of heroism and self sacrifice was more rarely sounded

There is in the Ossianic literature a conscious delight in and romance predominated and the iron string of heroism and self sacrifice was more rarely sounded

There is in the Ossianic literature a conscious delight in wild nature in scenery in the song of birds the music of the chase through the woods in mysterious and romantic adventure which speaks unmistakably of a time when the free open air life under the greenwood tree is looked back on and idealised but no longer habitually lived by those who celebrate it

Much of the action takes place amid the soft witchery of the Killarney landscape and the difference between the two regions is reflected in the ethical temper of the tales

In the Ultonian Cycle it will have been noticed that however extravagantly the supernatural element may be employed the final significance of almost every tale the end to which all the supernatural machinery is worked is something real and human something that has to do with the virtues or vices the passions or the duties or men and women

Now there were among the men at arms an old follower of Finn s father Cumhal who possessed a magic spear with a head of bronze and rivets of Arabian gold

The head was kept laced up in a leathern case and it had the property that when the naked blade was laid against the forehead of a man it would fill him with a strength and a battle fury that would make him invincible in every combat

This spear the man Fiacha gave to Finn and taught him how to use it and with it he awaited the coming of the goblin on the ramparts of Tara

As night fell and mists began to gather in the wide plain around the Hill he saw a shadowy form coming swiftly towards him and heard the notes of the magic harp

But laying the spear to his brow he shook off the spell and the phantom fled before him to the Fairy Mound of Slieve Fuad and there Finn overtook and slew him and bore back his head to Tara

Then Cormac the King set Finn before the Fianna and bade them all either swear obedience to him as their captain or seek service elsewhere

And first of all Goll mac Morna swore service and then all the rest followed and Finn became Captain of the Fianna of Erin and ruled them till he died

With the coming of Finn the Fianna of Erin came to their glory and with his life their glory passed away

For he ruled them as no other captain ever did both strongly and wisely and never bore a grudge against any but freely forgave a man all offences save disloyalty to his lord

Thus it is told that Conan son of the lord of Luachar him who had the Treasure Bag and whom Finn slew at Rath Luachar was for seven years an outlaw and marauder harrying the Fians and killing here a man and there a hound and firing dwellings and raiding their cattle

At last they ran him to a corner at Carn Lewy in Munster and when he saw that he could escape no more he stole upon Finn as he sat down after a chase and flung his arms round him from behind holding him fast and motionless

Conan mac Morna 

There was also another Conan namely mac Morna who was big and bald and unwieldy in manly exercises but whose tongue was bitter and scurrilous no high or brave thing was done that Conan the Bald did not mock and belittle

It Is said that when he was stripped he showed down his back and buttocks a black sheep s fleece instead of a man s skin and this is the way it came about

One day when Conan and certain others of the Fianna were hunting in the forest they came to a stately dun white walled with coloured thatching on the roof and they entered it to seek hospitality

But when they were within they found no man but a great empty hall with pillars of cedar wood and silken hangings about it like the hall of a wealthy lord

In the midst there was a table set forth with a sumptuous feast of boar s flesh and venison and a great vat of yew wood full of red wine and cups of gold and silver

So they set themselves gaily to eat and drink for they were hungry from the chase and talk and laughter were loud around the board

But one of them ere long started to his feet with a cry of fear and wonder and they all looked round and saw before their eyes the tapestried walls changing to rough wooden beams and the ceiling to foul sooty thatch like that of a herdsman s hut

So they knew they were being entrapped by some enchantment of the Fairy Folk and all sprang to their feet and made for the doorway that was no longer high and stately but was shrinking to the size of a fox earth all but Conan the Bald who was gluttonously devouring the good things on the table and heeded nothing else

Then they shouted to him and as the last of them went out he strove to rise and follow but found himself limed to the chair so that he could not stir

So two of the Fianna seeing his plight rushed back and seized his arms and tugged with all their might and as they dragged him away they left the most part of his raiment and his skin sticking to the chair

Then not knowing what else to do with him in his sore plight they clapped upon his back the nearest thing they could find which was the skin of a black sheep that they took from a peasant s flock hard by and it grew there and Conan wore it till his death

Though 
	| Though#r#1 - despite the fact that; "even though she knew the answer, she did not
	| respond"

This was on the day of the great battle with the pirate horde on the Hill of Slaughter in Kerry

the hill still bears the name Knockanar For Liagan one of the invaders stood out before the hosts and challenged the bravest of the Fians to single combat and the Fians in mockery thrust Conan forth to the fight

When he appeared Liagan laughed for he had more strength than wit and he said Silly is thy visit thou bald old man And as Conan still approached Liagan lifted his hand fiercely and Conan said Truly thou art in more peril from the man behind than from the man in front

Liagan looked round and in that instant Conan swept off his head and then threw his sword and ran for shelter to the ranks of the laughing Fians

He was so fair and noble to look on that no woman could refuse him love and it was said that he never knew weariness but his step was as light at the end of the longest day of battle or the chase as it was at the beginning

Between him and Finn there was great love until the day when Finn then an old man was to wed Grania daughter of Cormac the High King but Grania bound Dermot by the sacred ordinances of the Fian chivalry to fly with her on her wedding night which thing sorely against his will he did and thereby got his death

But Grania went back to Finn and when the Fianna saw her they laughed through all the camp in bitter mockery for they would not have given one of the dead man s fingers for twenty such as Grania

?Keelta? mac ?Ronan? and ?Oisin? 

Another of the chief men that Finn had was Keelta mac Ronan who was one of his house stewards and a strong warrior as well as a golden tongued reciter of tales and poems

He slew in his maiden battle three kings and in his fury he also slew by mischance his own friend and condisciple Linn

His wife was the fair Aideen who died of grief after Oscar s death in the battle of Gowra and Oisin buried her on Ben Edar Howth and raised over her the great dolmen which is there to this day

Oscar appears in this literature as a type of hard strength with a heart like twisted horn sheathed in steel a character made as purely for war as a sword or spear

?Geena? mac ?Luga? 

Another good man that Finn had was Geena the son of Luga his mother was the warrior daughter of Finn and his father was a near kinsman of hers

He was nurtured by a woman that bore the name of Fair Mane who had brought up many of the Fianna to manhood

When his time to take arms was come he stood before Finn and made his covenant of fealty and Finn gave him the captaincy of a band

But mac Luga proved slothful and selfish for ever vaunting himself and his weapon skill and never training his men to the chase of deer or boar and he used to beat his hounds and his serving men

At last the Fians under him came with their whole company to Finn at Loch Lena in Killarney and there they laid their complaint against mac Luga and said Choose now O Finn whether you will have us or the son of Luga by himself Then Finn sent to mac Luga and questioned him but mac Luga could say nothing to the point as to why the Fianna would none of him

Then Finn taught him the things befitting a youth of noble birth and a captain of men and they were these

And now what fee will ye give me for my rescue of you from the worst affliction that ever befell you A great reward said the Fairy Folk even youth for by our art we shall change you into a young man again with all the strength and activity of your prime

Nay God forbid said Keelta that I should take upon me a shape of sorcery or any other than that which my Maker the true and glorious God hath bestowed upon me And the Fairy Folk said It is the word of a true warrior and hero and the thing that thou sayest is good

Of all hounds in Ireland they were the best and Finn loved them much so that it was said he wept but twice in his life and once was for the death of Bran

Because I would not give my love to the Druid of the Fairy Folk who is named the Dark he put that shape upon me by his sorceries and I have borne it these three years

But a slave of his pitying me once revealed to me that if I could win to thy great Dun of Allen O Finn I should be safe from all enchantments and my natural shape would come to me again

But I feared to be torn in pieces by thy dogs or wounded by thy hunters till at last I let myself be overtaken by thee alone and by Bran and Skolawn who have the nature of man and would do me no hurt

Have no fear maiden said Finn we the Fianna are free and our guest friends are free there is none who shall put compulsion on you here

So Saba dwelt with Finn and he made her his wife and so deep was his love for her that neither the battle nor the chase had any delight for him and for months he never left her side

She also loved him as deeply and their joy in each other was like that of the Immortals in the Land of Youth

But at last word came to Finn that the warships of the Northmen were in the Bay of Dublin and he summoned his heroes to the fight For said he to Saba the men of Erin give us tribute and hospitality to defend them from the foreigner and it were shame to take it from them and not to give that to which we on our side are pledged

But on the eighth day he returned and when he entered his dun he saw trouble in the eyes of his men and of their fair womenfolk and Saba was not on the rampart expecting his return

So he bade them tell him what had chanced and they said Whilst thou our father and lord wert afar oft smiting the foreigner and Saba looking ever down the pass for thy return we saw one day as it were the likeness of thee approaching and Bran and Skolawn at thy heels

Then Saba hastened to the great gate and we could not stay her so eager was she to rush to the phantom

But when she came near she halted and gave a loud and bitter cry and the shape of thee smote her with a hazel wand and lo there was no woman there any more but a deer

Then those hounds chased it and ever as it strove to reach again the gate of the dun they turned back

We all now seized what arms we could and ran out to drive away the enchanter but when we reached the place there was nothing to be seen only still we heard the rushing of flying feet and the baying of dogs and one thought it came from here and another from there till at last the uproar died away and all was still

One day as he was following the chase on Ben Bulban in Sligo he heard the musical bay of the dogs change of a sudden to a fierce growling and yelping as though they were in combat with some beast and running hastily up he and his men beheld under a great tree a naked boy with long hair and around him the hounds struggling to seize him but Bran and Skolawn fighting with them and keeping them off

And the lad was tall and shapely and as the heroes gathered round he gazed undauntedly on them never heeding the rout of dogs at his feet

The Fians beat off the dogs and brought the lad home with them and Finn was very silent and continually searched the lad s countenance with his eyes

In time the use of speech came to him and the story that he told was this He had known no father and no mother save a gentle hind with whom he lived in a most green and pleasant valley shut in on every side by towering cliffs that could not be scaled or by deep chasms in the earth

In the summer he lived on fruits and suchlike and in the winter store of provisions was laid for him in a cave

And there came to them sometimes a tall dark visaged man who spoke to his mother now tenderly and now in loud menace but she always shrank away in fear and the man departed in anger

At last there came a day when the dark man spoke very long with his mother in all tones of entreaty and of tenderness and of rage but she would still keep aloof and give no sign save of fear and abhorrence

Then at length the dark man drew near and smote her with a hazel wand and with that he turned and went his way but she this time followed him still looking back at her son and piteously complaining

And he when he strove to follow found him self unable to move a limb and crying out with rage and desolation he fell to the earth and his senses left him

When he came to himself he was on the mountain side on Ben Bulban where he remained some days searching for that green and hidden valley which he never found again

And after a while the dogs found him but of the hind his mother and of the Dark Druid there is no man knows the end

Finn called his name Oisin Little Fawn and he became a warrior of fame but far more famous for the songs and tales that he made so that of all things to this day that are told of the Fianna of Erin men are wont to say Thus sang the bard Oisin son of Finn

Oisin and ?Niam? 

It happened that on a misty summer morning as Finn and Oisin with many companions were hunting on the shores of Loch Lena they saw coming towards them a maiden beautiful exceedingly riding on a snow white steed

She wore the garb of a queen a crown of gold was on her head and a dark brown mantle of silk set with stars of red gold fell around her and trailed on the ground
